## MPF-1P Tape Data Reader

A python script to read programs for the MPF-1P from audio (e.g. .wav) files.

When I was 14 I bought an MPF-1P single board computer. My Z80 assembler programs I stored on cassette tape. Before discarding the tape one day, fortunately I made a backup of the audio on it on a .wav file. 

The script in this repository attempts to read this data and convert it into a number of .asm files. It works reasonably well, but not perfectly. Sorry.
